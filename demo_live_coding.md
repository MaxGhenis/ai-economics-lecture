# Live Claude Code Demo: Building Economic Research in Real-Time

## Demo Script for USC Economics PhD Class

### Opening (Before Starting)
"Now I want to show you Claude Code in action. I'm going to ask it to solve a real research problem that combines everything we've discussed - structural econometrics, computational methods, and machine learning. Watch how it approaches this systematically."

### The Prompt I'll Give Claude Code:

```
Create a structural estimation of labor supply elasticity using the EITC as a natural experiment. 

Requirements:
1. Use PolicyEngine's microsimulation with enhanced CPS data
2. Implement a structural labor supply model 
3. Use machine learning to estimate parameters
4. Create heterogeneous effects analysis
5. Conduct welfare analysis
6. Make it publication-ready with tests
7. Use TDD approach throughout

This is for second-year PhD students studying computational methods, so show advanced techniques but explain clearly.
```

### What to Watch For:

1. **Test-First Development**: Notice how Claude Code writes tests before implementation
2. **Systematic Approach**: See how it breaks down the complex problem
3. **Documentation**: Automatic creation of academic-quality documentation
4. **Error Handling**: Watch how it debugs and fixes issues
5. **Best Practices**: Observe the use of version control, testing, validation

### Key Teaching Points:

#### 1. Research Workflow Automation
- Literature integration
- Data pipeline creation
- Model specification
- Results validation

#### 2. Computational Methods
- Structural model solving
- Parameter estimation via ML
- Welfare optimization
- Monte Carlo simulation

#### 3. The "100% Claude Code" Philosophy
- Never write code manually
- Let AI handle implementation
- Focus on research design
- Iterate through conversation

### Live Coding Segments:

#### Segment 1: Setup and Data (2 minutes)
- Watch Claude Code set up the project
- See how it accesses PolicyEngine data
- Notice the test-driven approach

#### Segment 2: Structural Model (3 minutes)
- Observe model specification
- See parameter initialization
- Watch optimization setup

#### Segment 3: Machine Learning (3 minutes)
- See gradient boosting implementation
- Watch cross-validation
- Notice feature engineering

#### Segment 4: Results and Visualization (2 minutes)
- Watch publication-quality figures emerge
- See welfare analysis
- Notice robustness checks

### Interactive Elements:

**For Students to Try:**
1. "Can you make the elasticity vary by demographic group?"
2. "Add a difference-in-differences specification"
3. "Include general equilibrium effects"
4. "Create an interactive dashboard"

### The Power of Claude Code for Economics:

1. **Speed**: Complete analysis in minutes, not days
2. **Quality**: Publication-ready code with best practices
3. **Reproducibility**: Everything documented and tested
4. **Learning**: See advanced techniques implemented correctly
5. **Innovation**: Try ideas quickly without implementation burden

### Common Student Questions:

**Q: Can it handle my specific econometric model?**
A: Yes, describe it clearly and Claude Code will implement it

**Q: What about data I can't share?**
A: Claude Code can create synthetic data matching your specifications

**Q: Can it write in Stata/R/Julia?**
A: Yes, it's polyglot - just specify your preference

**Q: Will it cite papers correctly?**
A: Yes, and it can even fetch and summarize relevant literature

### Demonstration Talking Points:

"Notice how I'm not writing any code myself - this is the key insight. As economists, we should focus on the research questions and methodology, not the implementation details."

"See how it automatically creates tests? This ensures our results are reliable and reproducible."

"Watch how it handles the structural model - it's using the exact techniques from your coursework but implementing them automatically."

"This is particularly powerful for trying different specifications quickly. Want to test robustness? Just ask for it."

### Closing Points:

1. **This changes the research process**: Focus on ideas, not implementation
2. **It's a collaboration**: You provide expertise, Claude Code provides implementation
3. **Quality improves**: More time for thinking, automatic best practices
4. **Research accelerates**: Test more hypotheses, iterate faster

### Demo Variations Based on Time:

**Quick (5 minutes)**: Just show the structural model estimation
**Standard (10 minutes)**: Full demo with welfare analysis
**Extended (15 minutes)**: Add student suggestions live
**Workshop (30 minutes)**: Let students drive Claude Code themselves

### Key Takeaway:
"The future of computational economics isn't about writing better code - it's about asking better questions and letting AI handle the implementation."
